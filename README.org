#+TITLE: plmlib

This is the library I will use to write PL/M programs under DOS.  It
is written using the usual Intel PL/M-86 library.  The purpose is to
be a translation layer between my library and the Intel library.
Because I would like to be able to use not only DOS, but also CP/M-86
and CP/M-80.  This way the PL/M code will not have to change, only the
library.

For now it will only be the DOS library because it's the OS I use at
the moment to write PL/M programs.  It has some advantages compared to
PL/M-80 such as longer identifier names, so PL/M-86 code is more
readable.
